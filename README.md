This repository contains a simple example of a stack overflow error in a recursive function written in Hack. The function `foo` calculates the factorial of a number using recursion. When called with a large argument, it exceeds the maximum recursion depth, resulting in a stack overflow error. The solution demonstrates how to mitigate this by adding a check for maximum recursion depth and throwing an exception if it's exceeded.
